A collection of projects I've been working on in order to demonstrate knowledge over different areas in Cyber Security. Some of these projects formed part of online courses I have been taking from various training providers like Google and WithYouWithMe (WYWM). WYWM is an initiative focused on guiding veterans/currently serving military personnel into tech focused careers. I embarked on their Cyber Pathway which included an array of learning materials, followed by knowledge confirmation in the form of multi-choice, question based assessments and capstone projects (which I have documented in this repository). The Google Cyber Security Certification follows the same process.
